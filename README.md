# BankSim – Banking Simulation Project

## ?? Overview
**BankSim** is a .NET Core–based banking simulation project with a modular architecture.  
It supports core banking features such as account management, transactions, currency conversion, and invoice payments.  
The solution also includes a **separate Invoice.API** service for managing and paying utility bills.
